Shadows Left Behind is a **2.5D single-player story game** set inside a quiet, smoke-stained house filled with fragments of memory.  
The player moves through rooms once touched by warmth and now hollowed by loss, collecting glowing clues that reveal what happened on the night of the fire—a tragedy that forever bound the house to the memory of the protagonist’s mother.  

The game explores the contrast between **Light and Darkness**, representing two emotional paths through grief and acceptance.  
After collecting all clues in a room, the player faces a short **Quest**, choosing between Light or Darkness.  
Success or failure determines the emotional tone of the next scene but not its difficulty.  

Shadows Left Behind was created to provide a **calm, reflective, and emotional gaming experience** told through visuals and sound rather than dialogue.  

The **target users** for Shadows Left Behind are **players aged 12 and older** who enjoy atmospheric, story-based games like *Sally Face*, *Inside*, and *Gris*.  
It’s designed to be accessible for both casual and experienced players seeking meaningful, artistic storytelling.  

The world of Shadows Left Behind unfolds within a **memory-wrapped house**—the Bedroom, Hallway, Kitchen, and Attic—each revealing fragments of a night that ended in fire.  
Every room exists in two states:  

- **Light Realm:** serene, golden light and gentle melodies.  
- **Darkness Realm:** ashen tones, faint embers, and silence.  

The goal of the game is to **collect all glowing clues** and **complete each Quest**, shaping how the world remembers—through light, darkness, or both.
